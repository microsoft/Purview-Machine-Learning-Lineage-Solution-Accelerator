# Purview Machine Learning Lineage Solution Accelerator 

Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern data across different sources.

Machine Learning project life cycle involves many steps to transform raw data into insights. This process usually requires individuals with different roles/skillsets across multiple teams to collaborate effectively. Microsoft Purview helps simplify this complex process by providing an end-to-end lineage of ML entities and processes to enable better collaboration, auditing and debugging capabilities.

This solution accelerator helps developers with the resources needed to build an end-to-end lineage in Purview for Machine Learning scenarios.

## Prerequisites
To use this solution accelerator, you will need access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). While not required, a prior understanding of Microsoft Purview, Azure Synapse Analytics and Machine Learning will be helpful.

For additional training and support, please see:
1. [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/purview/) 
2. [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) 
3. [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) 

## Getting Started
Start by deploying the required resources to Azure. The button below will deploy Microsoft Purview, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Machine Learning and its related resources:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FPurview-Machine-Learning-Lineage-Solution-Accelerator%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fdeploy.json)

If you prefer to setup manually, you need to deploy Microsoft Purview, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Machine Learning.

Note: To minimize Azure costs, consider deleting the Purview instance at the end of this exercise if you do not plan to use this instance actively. 

### Step 1. Download Files
Clone or download this repository and navigate to the project's root directory.

### Step 2. Purview Security Access

#### Step 2.1 Create a Service Principal for Purview Rest API access
[Create a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/tutorial-using-rest-apis#create-a-service-principal-application)

#### Step 2.2 Configure your Purview catalog to trust the service principal
[Configure your Purview catalog to trust the service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/tutorial-using-rest-apis#configure-your-catalog-to-trust-the-service-principal-application)

### Step 3. Azure Machine Learning Security Access

#### Step 3.1 Create a Service Principal for AML access
[Create a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/tutorial-using-rest-apis#create-a-service-principal-application)

#### Step 3.2 Configure your Azure Machine Learning to trust the service principal
1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select your AML workspace
2. select Access Control (IAM)
3. Select Add, Add Role Assignment to open the Add role assignment page

	3.1 For the `Role` type in `Contributor`
	
	3.2 For `Assign access to` leave the default, `User, group, or service principal`
	
	3.2 For `Select` enter the name of the previosly created service principal in step 3.1 and then click on their name in the results pane
	
	3.3 Click on Save
You've now configured the service principal as a contributor on Azure Machine Learning resource.

### Step 4. Synapse Security Access

#### Step 4.1 Add your IP address to Synapse firewall
Before you can upload assests to the Synapse Workspace you will need to add your IP address:
1. Go to the Synapse resource you created in the previous step
2. Navigate to `Firewalls` under `Security` on the left hand side of the page
3. At the top of the screen click `+ Add client IP`
	![Update Firewalls](./Deployment/img/deploy-firewall.png)  
4. Your IP address should now be visable in the IP list

#### Step 4.2: Update storage account permisions 
In order to perform the necessary actions in Synapse workspace, you will need to grant more access.
1. Go to the Azure Data Lake Storage Account created above
2. Go to the `Access Control (IAM) > + Add > Add role assignment` 
3. Now click the Role dropdown and select `Storage Blob Data Contributor`
	- Search for your username and add
4. Click `Save` at the bottom

### Step 5. Upload CreditRisk Sample Dataset
1. Launch the Synapse workspace [Synapse Workspace](https://ms.web.azuresynapse.net/)
2. Select the `subscription` and `workspace` name you are using for this solution accelerator
3. In Synapse Studio, navigate to the `Data` Hub
4. Select `Linked`
5. Under the category `Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2` you'll see an item with a name like `xxxxx(xxxxx- Primary)`
6. Select the container named `data (Primary)`
7. Create a new folder `creditriskdata`
8. Select `Upload` and select `loan.csv` and `borrower.csv` files downloaded from [Data](./Data/) folder

### Step 6. Register and scan uploaded data in Purview

1. [Setting up authentication for a scan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/register-scan-adls-gen2#managed-identity-recommended)

2. [Register and scan adls gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/register-scan-adls-gen2#register-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-data-source) 

select only the `creditriskdata` folder while creating the scan.
